# Databricks Notebook Modularization Practice

This project is a basic demonstration of how to modularize code in Databricks by splitting functionality across multiple notebooks. It focuses on organizing reusable functions and running one notebook from another to improve maintainability and clarity.

- Calling one Databricks notebook from another
- Separating logic into dedicated utility notebooks
- Reusing functions across notebooks to reduce code duplication
- Practicing a modular approach for larger Databricks projects

This setup is useful for structuring production-quality notebooks or building reusable components for data pipelines and analytics workflows.
